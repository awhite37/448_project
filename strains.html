                            <h3>Background On Earlier Coronavirus Strains</h3>
                            <p> Different COVID-19 strains share common characteristics such as genetic organization, the envelope, membrane, spike, and the nucleocapsid. Each of the mutations in the RNA virus is an alteration in the nucleotide sequence in the genome of the organism, which leads to evolution of the virus over time. RNA viruses are known to have much higher mutation rates than other DNA viruses and millions of times higher than their hosts. The lack of efficiency in proofreading of RNA polymerases is one of the contributing factors of very high mutation rates. Although all of these factors are true, the coronavirus is one of the largest known RNA virus, which leads to much lower mutation rates in this virus than most others. </p>
                            <p>
                                The whole genome sequence alignment looking at the strains of coronaviruses reveals 54% identity among various CoV strains, with the coding regions alone showing 58% identity. Although these numbers are specifically looking at strains of CoV, the percent identity between SARS-CoV2 strains and different CoV strains are between 70 and 96 percent, which is quite high. This shows us that the genomes of the two viruses are fairly similar. Proteomic analyses between SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 have shown that around 95%-100% of the proteins are highly homologous. 
                            </p>
                            <p>After extensive analysis of SARS-CoV2, it was observed that the community transmission outbreak of this virus is much greater than that of SARS-CoV. Although the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV in its percent identity and proteins, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher, which is one of the reasons why it has spread so quickly throughout the world. One of the main reasons for the very high transmission rate is the binding affinity of a specific protein. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very structurally similar, with both binding to a human ACE2 receptor to cause infection. However, the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the receptor with much higher protein affinity (about 10 to 20 times more), compared to the spike bonding of SARS-CoV. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Researchers do not believe that one strain of SARS-CoV-2 is more deadly than the others and that the strains should not evolve to become more lethal. Rapidly sequencing the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples from patients has led to the ability to track the mutations of the virus. Knowing that no strain is more lethal than one another, there must be some factors that cause the virus to affect some individuals more severely than it affects others. There are some general factors that make one individual more susceptible than another such as age and preexisting conditions. Older individuals are more likely to become more sick when infected with the virus, and those with conditions such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer are much more likely to be affected severely. More specifically, scientists have recently discovered that a genetic difference in the host may affect how severe someone will become ill when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists believe that a certain gene could be an essential player in how severely someone is affected by the virus. It was discovered by scientists from the Radboud University Medical Center that individuals who had a variant loss of function in the gene TLR7, along with defects in the production of immune system molecules type I and II interferons made young patients who did not have any preexisting medical conditions predisposed to the virus.

                                SARS-CoV-2 has a genome of only 30,000 base pairs, with divergent strains having only an 11 base pair difference. It is believed that the first strains of coronavirus in the U.S. came from a man who had been in Wuhan, China, and returned to the United States on January 15th. The strain that he had was only 3 base pairs away from the original coronavirus strain. The original strain of coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan, China is the L strain. The first mutation is known as the S strain, which appeared at the beginning of 2020. Strains V and G showed up in mid-January. Strain G is the most widespread strain of SARS-CoV-2 so far. Strain G has mutated into strains GR and GH near the end of February 2020. These three strains represent 74% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases. These have 4 mutations, where 2 are able to change the RNA polymerase and spike proteins sequence to facilitate the spread. Strains G and GR are the most common across Europe and Italy, while the GH strain is the most commonly found in the United States, France, and Germany. The GR strain is most common in South America, and strain S is the most common in Spain. The O strain is the most common in Asia, and the GV strain is the most common in Europe
