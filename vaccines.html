                             <br><h3>Current Vaccine Candidates</h3>
                            <p> Shown below is a table with data from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker">raps.org</a> website that gives updated information about possible future vaccines. Click the green button next to each table entry for more details about each vaccine candidate. Each candiate also has listed the mechanism of the vaccine, sponsors for the research, the institution conducting the research, and the current trial phase the candidate is in. The clinical phases are approached once the researches gain approval for testing their respective vaccines. During clinical testing, the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is tested. In phase 1, a small group of people receive the trial vaccine. In phase 2, the study is expanded and the vaccine is given to individuals who have similar characteristics, like age and physical health, to those for whom the new vaccine is intended for. Finally, in phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and is tested for efficacy and safety. This is the clinical phase in which multiple vaccine options are currently in.
                            Although, through our research, and by the proposed phylogenetic tree we have input onto our website, it seems like the 8 identified strains of covid-19 are not very different from each other. Therefore, one vaccine should, theoretically, be able to fight against each strain.

                            <p>Sequence data for the potential vaccines are currently not available for public knowledge, possibly for proprietary reasons. As a result, we were unable to use any sequence alignment software to hypothesize which strain of COVID-19 would best be suited for a specific proposed vaccine. If this data were publicly available for us to use for the purposes of this website, we would have: (1) obtained the full genome sequences of what we considered to be the most likely future vaccine(s), i.e. any vaccine(s) currently in phase 3 clinical trials; and (2) with each individual vaccine, we would have done a pairwise alignment against all 8 strains of COVID-19 to determine the best vaccine/strain combination. Since we are unable to do this, we instead present a list of vaccines that are currently in clinical trials.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Promising Candidates</h2>
                            
                            <h3>Pfiszer Vaccine</h3>
                            <p>Pfizer partnered up with BioNTech to develop a new SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with promising results. This vaccine will be tested first in the United States to create late-stage data. The drug is still being tested and is currently in a Phase 3 study. The study has enrolled 43,538 total participants, with 42% of global volunteers and 30% of U.S. volunteers that have ethnically and racially diverse backgrounds. 38,955 participants in the study have already received their second dose. Analysis of the results thus far detail that there were more than 90% fewer symptomatic COVID-19 cases in patients that receive two injections of the vaccine at three weeks apart when compared to those who received a placebo. This vaccine will not be filed for emergency authorization to allow for distribution until after half of the patients in the study have been observed for safety problems for at least two months after their second dose, which is expected to happen in the third week of November. </p>
                            <p> This vaccine utilizes mRNA technology to deliver genetic information that causes the body to create a protein from the virus. Because of this, the immune system is now able to recognize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can attack. The first stage of analysis was supposed to involve 32 patients who received either the vaccine or a placebo and then contracted COVID-19. If fewer than six volunteers who received the vaccine had developed COVID-19, the vaccine would be deemed effective. This study was then supposed to go on until at least 164 COVID-19 cases were reported. Instead, after a discussion with the FDA, the plan was changed to conduct the analysis after 62 cases, but by the time this was decided there were already 94 cases of COVID-19 in the study. While this change caused the release date for the vaccine to be further in the future, it improved the statistical strength of the study.
                                </p>
                                <p>While a speedy vaccine is instrumental to world health, some details have been overlooked. There is not currently any information on whether the vaccine can prevent severe cases of SARS-CoV-2, which often result in hospitalization and death, or if it can prevent people from becoming carriers of the virus which do not display any symptoms. The vaccine also causes side effects including aches or fevers, but is said to be no worse than a flu shot. If authorized, the vaccine must be stored at extremely low temperatures, which would make it difficult to transfer and may cause distribution challenges. 
                </p>
                        <h3>Moderna Vaccine</h3>
                        <p>Moderna, Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, co-developed the mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This vaccine combines Moderna’s mRNA delivery platform with the stabilized COVID-19 spike immunogen, which was developed by NIAID. The interim analysis of the vaccine was shared with the trial oversight group on November 15, 2020. The review gives details which suggest that the vaccine is effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults. The safety and monitoring board that was overseeing this vaccine trial reported a vaccine efficacy rate of 94.5%. </p>
                        <p>Over 30,000 participants and 100 different clinical research sites across the United States are currently participating in this study, which first launched on July 27, 2020. The companies running the trials recognize the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on underrepresented minority populations, and therefore they worked with different community engagement partners to enroll a diverse group of participants. 37% of the volunteers of the trial are from racial and ethnic minorities. Moderna has stated that it intends to file “in the coming weeks for FDA authorization of the vaccine for use.
                        </p>
                        <p>Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are mRNA based, and use the same technology to make their vaccines. The vaccine trials differed slightly, where Moderna participants had to have at least two symptoms of disease in addition to a positive test for the virus, while the Pfizer study only required one. The vaccines also differ in their storage requirements, which could potentially put the Moderna vaccine above Pfizer’s in this regard. Moderna has stated that its vaccine is able to be stored in freezers at about 25°F (4°C), which is a temperature that can be easily reached by an at-home refrigerator freezer. These types of  freezers are also typically carried at doctors offices and vaccine distributors. Pfizer’s vaccine, however, is required to be stored in specialized ultracold freezers that are capable of cooling below -94°F (-70°C), which are not typically carried at doctor’s offices or vaccine distributors.
