                            <h3>History of Coronaviruses</h3>
                            <p>

                                There is a large family of coronaviruses, and 15-30% of common colds are due to coronaviruses. The first human coronaviruses were discovered in the mid-1960s when technology allowed viruses to be grown in the lab. The first two coronaviruses ever identified were OC43 and 229E. OC43 was the coronavirus that was most commonly associated with human infections, and not much is currently known about its evolution. Both OC43 and 229E normally cause mild to moderate upper respiratory illness. Another strain similar to these two, NL63, was discovered in the Netherlands in 2004, and the genome and symptoms of this virus do not differ too much between these two. HKU1 was discovered shortly after in 2005 in Hong Kong as another common-cold causing coronavirus. </p><p>
        
                            SARS-CoV was the first deadly outbreak of a coronavirus that occurred, which happened in 2002. It proved to be fatal to ten percent of those infected, with a total of 774 deaths worldwide. It was believed to have originated in bats and transferred to humans through some type of intermediary organism such as civets. Viruses are more deadly if they have the ability to switch their target species, due to their quick mutation rates. This may be the reasoning for SARS-CoV having such a high death rate. MERS-CoV was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and led to around 2,500 cases worldwide, with an extremely high fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV-2, which was originally named 2019-nCoV, came around in late 2019 This coronavirus is highly transmissible with around 50 million cases worldwide and 1.25 million deaths so far. It affects people very differently from those who are hospitalized and put on ventilators to those who exhibit no symptoms and are just a carrier of the disease. </p><p>

                            SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on December 31, 2019 in Wuhan, China. This new virus spread rapidly through CHina within a few weeks and spread to new countries within a month. It was hard to control the spread in China due to the large density of China’s population. Wuhan is a large transportation hub in central China. China’s wide range of transportation was shut down on January 23, 2020, but around 5 million people had already passed through Wuhan before the shutdown. Ganzu Province in northwestern China realized the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 and on January 28, 2020, mandated that face masks must be worn in public. There was only a 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS related coronavirus, with the differences at neutral sites at 17%. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients share a 99.9% identity which suggests a recent shift to humans. </p>
                                <h3>What makes SARS-CoV-2 so much more infectious than SARS-CoV?
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                   Many people have been wondering what makes SARS-CoV-2 so different from SARS-CoV for it to cause such an elevated infection rate. There are multiple factors that can account for this difference, but we will be focusing on one factor. What some researchers have been suggesting is that the increased rate of infection could partly be due to the genetic differences between the spike proteins that exist between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 
                                        The human coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 are the only coronaviruses out of the entire list we mentioned earlier that have this spike protein. The spike protein is what these viruses use to bind to the membranes in human host cells. This is a crucial step for the survival of the virus. These proteins are then activated by some enzymes, like furin, which allows the virus to bind to more cells in different organs from where it had initially infected.  </p>
                                <p>
                                    After running a pairwise sequence alignment between SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2, this is what we found with respect to how similar/different the same protein is between the three coronaviruses. The spike protein in MERS-CoV has 51% positives with both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This means that the spike protein sequences between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are 51% identical and 49% different. This is the same case for the spike proteins between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, the spike protein in SARS-CoV has 86% positives with SARS-CoV-2. This means that the spike protein sequences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 86% identical and 24% different.
                                </p>
                                <p>After we ran the three pairwise alignments listed above, we decided to create a visual representation of the relatedness between the three spike proteins. In order to do this, we first ran a multiple sequence alignment between the three spike proteins. This was then used to create a phylogenetic tree, which is represented below.<br>
                                </p>
                                <div class=aligncenter> <br>
                            <iframe src="phylotree_small.html" title="Iframe phylotree" style="height:400px;width:400px;border:1px solid gray;"></iframe>
                                    </div>
                                    <p><br>
                                      SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and their respective spike proteins, are more closely related to each other than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are. In light of this, we decided to focus our explanation for what we believe is a contributing factor to the heightened infectious rates of SARS-CoV-2 by only looking at the spike proteins in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 
                                        The spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 binds 10x more tightly to human host cells than the spike protein in SARS-CoV. This characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 is being considered as one of the factors causing its enhanced rate of infection. An individual might come into contact with either of the two SARS coronaviruses, but if the virus is unable to bind to your cells, it will just be flushed out of your system. However, if the virus has an increased ability to bind to your cells, it will most likely stick around and infect you. So, because SARS-CoV-2 has such an enhanced ability to bind to human host cells, it would make sense to conclude that it could potentially result in a higher rate of infection than SARS-CoV, whose ability to bind to human host cells is not as strong. However, the severity of the virus once it enters your system is more dependent on the individual than on the virus itself. Therefore, the mutation(s) in the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that allows for the enhanced ability of the virus to bind to human host cells can only explain why it is more infectious, but not why it causes severe symptoms or even death in some individuals but not in others.
